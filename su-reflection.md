*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? 
I had some confusion around merging and pushing and pulling to GitHub.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
How to merge locally and with remote and the difference between fetching/merging and pulling.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Again, mostly questions about how to sync our (my pair and I's) repositories through the different methods of merging, pushing, pulling, fetching. 

*What still confuses you about Git?
We had an issue at the end where I wasn't able to push back up to GitHub because of a sync issue that we didn't have time to figure out--so still would love more clarification about different situations that would cause this to happen.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was awesome! Anthony and I worked well together and it was so helpful to have Matthew there to answer our questions and confirm our reasoning. Looking forward to the next one!
